## What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud Computing is a means of storing and accessing the data and programs on remote servers that are hosted on the internet instead of the computerâ€™s hard drive or local server. Cloud computing is also referred to as Internet-based computing, it is a technology where the resource is provided as a service through the Internet to the user. The data that is stored can be files, images, documents, or any other storable document.

### The following are some of the Operations that can be performed with Cloud Computing:-

- Storage, backup, and recovery of data
- Delivery of software on demand
- Development of new applications and services
- Streaming videos and audio

## Understanding Cloud Computing

Cloud computing helps users in easily accessing computing resources like storage, and processing over internet rather than local hardwares. Here we discussing how it works in nutshell:

- <b> Infrastructure: </b> Cloud computing depends on remote network servers hosted on internet for store, manage, and process the data.
- <b> On-Demand Acess: </b> Users can access cloud services and resources based on-demand they can scale up or down the without having to invest for physical hardware.
- <b> Types of Services: </b> Cloud computing offers various benefits such as cost saving, scalability, reliability and acessibility it reduces capital expenditures, improves efficiency.

## Virtualization in Cloud Computing

Virtualization is the software technology that helps in providing the logical isolation of physical resources. Creating logical isolation of physical resources such as RAM, CPU, and Storage. over the cloud is known as Virtualization in Cloud Computing. In simple we can say creating types of Virtual Instances of computing resources over the cloud. It provides better management and utilization of hardware resources with logical isolation making the applications independent of others. It facilitates streamlining the resource allocation and enhancing scalability for multiple virtual computers within a single physical source offering cost-effectiveness and better optimization of resources.

## Architecture of Cloud Computing

- <u> Front end ( Fat client, Thin client) </u>

The User Interface of Cloud Computing consists of 2 sections of clients. The Thin clients are the ones that use web browsers facilitating portable and lightweight accessibilities and others are known as Fat Clients that use many functionalities for offering a strong user experience.

- <u> Back-end platforms ( Servers, Storage ) </u>

The core of cloud computing is made at back-end platforms with several servers for storage and processing computing. Management of Applications logic is managed through servers and effective data handling is provided by storage. The combination of these platforms at the backend offers the processing power, and capacity to manage and store data behind the cloud.

- <u> Cloud-based delivery and a network ( Internet, Intranet, Intercloud ) <u>

On-demand access to the computer and resources is provided over the Internet, Intranet, and Intercloud. The Internet comes with global accessibility, the Intranet helps in internal communications of the services within the organization and the Intercloud enables interoperability across various cloud services. This dynamic network connectivity ensures an essential component of cloud computing architecture on guaranteeing easy access and data transfer.
